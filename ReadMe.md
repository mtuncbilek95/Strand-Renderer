# Strand Renderer

This is a simple renderer for PBR shading. It is based on my custom game engine called Strand 
Engine. It is written in C++ and DirectX 11. It is a work in progress and is not yet complete. Strand Engine
is also currently supports DirectX 11, but I am planning to add support for DirectX 12 and Vulkan in the 
future and remove DirectX 11 support. This rendering engine is a mini version of Strand Engine. It supports
only 1 Framebuffer and 1 Render Pass. It also does not support instancing.

## Features To Be Supported

- PBR Shading
- Model Loading
- Customization on the material properties
- Customization on the light properties
- Path Tracing in Compute Shader
- Intel Sponza Scene
- Basic Imgui Interface to control the properties

## FOR THOSE WHO CAN NOT SEE STRAND ENGINE REPOSITORY

Since Strand Engine will be my future fully functioned game engine __(which will be used in my own games or in the 
games of companies that my team and I will work with under contract)__, I decided to make it private. The PBR shading 
system, which will be created with a simple Sphere, mostly has the same lines as the Strand Engine. If you really 
would like to see the game engine to evaluate my work quality and working principles, please contact me via email 
or Discord. I can set a date for the live meeting and show you the details of the architecture I have
created by sharing the screen. All rights of Strand Engine are reserved by Metehan Tuncbilek.

Thank you for your understanding.
